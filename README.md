#Screen Space Subsurface Scattering

An implementation of a set screen space physically-based subsurface scattering algorithms ([Screen-Space Perceptual Rendering of Human Skin](http://www.iryoku.com/sssss/), [Separable Subsurface Scattering](http://iryoku.com/separable-sss/)) in order to improve the rendering of scanned human faces.
Moreover, it presents extensions and introduces some PBR strategies to produce high quality renders.
